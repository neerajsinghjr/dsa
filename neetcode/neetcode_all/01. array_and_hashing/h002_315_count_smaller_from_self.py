        _brief: --- optimized with merge sort algorithm ---
        - this method calculates, for each number in the input array `nums`, the count of 
        smaller numbers that appear strictly to its right.
        - it leverages a modified Merge Sort algorithm, which is augmented to perform the 
        counting during its efficient merging phase.
            - Algorithm Breakdown:
                - An auxiliary `result` list of size `n` (initialized to zeros) is created to 
                store the final counts for each original index.
                - Each number from `nums` is paired with its original index `(og_index, value)` 
                using `enumerate` to preserve its position through sorting.
            - Recursive Sorting:
                - The `merge_sort` function recursively divides the list of `(index, value)` 
                pairs into smaller sub-arrays until they are trivially sorted.
            - Augmented Merging (Core Logic):
                - when merging two sorted sub-arrays (left and right halves):
                - if an element `(idx_L, val_L)` from the `left` sub-array is chosen (because 
                `val_L <= val_R`):
                    - Its `result[idx_L]` entry is incremented by `j`, where `j` is the count 
                    of elements already moved from the `right` sub-array. These `j` elements 
                    are guaranteed to be smaller than `val_L` and were originally located to 
                    its right.
                - If an element from the `right` sub-array is chosen (because `val_R < val_L`):-
                    - It is simply appended to the merged list, and `j` is incremented. No count 
                    is added to `result` for `val_R` at this step, as it's not being compared 
                    against elements from its original left side.
                    - After processing one of the sub-arrays, any remaining elements from the `left`
                    sub-array are appended to the merged list, and their `result` count is updated 
                    by the total number of elements successfully merged from the `right` sub-array 
                    (which is the final value of `j`).
        - Example:
            - Input: nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]
            - Initial: result = [0, 0, 0, 0]
            - Initial: enum = [(0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 6), (3, 1)]`
            - During Merge Operations
                - When `5` (original index 0) is processed, numbers `2` and `1` 
                (which were originally to its right) are found to be smaller. result[0] becomes 2
                - When `2` (original index 1) is processed, number `1` 
                (originally to its right) is found to be smaller. result[1] becomes 1
                - When `6` (original index 2) is processed, number `1` 
                (originally to its right) is found to be smaller. result[2] becomes 1
                - Number `1` (original index 3) has no elements to its right. result[3] is 0
            - Output: result = [2, 1, 1, 0]
