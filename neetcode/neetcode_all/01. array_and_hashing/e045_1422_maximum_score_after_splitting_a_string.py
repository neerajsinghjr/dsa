        _brief:
        - solves the problem by maximizing the score from splitting the binary string `s`into 
        two non-empty parts.
        - the score is calculated as the number of '0's in the left part plus the number of '1's 
        in the right part.
        - we first count all '1's in the string (to represent the initial right side). Then, as 
        we iterate through the string (excluding the last index),
        - we increment a counter for '0's on the left and decrement the '1's from the right as 
        we pass them.
        - at each step, we compute the current score and track the maximum encountered.

        _brief:
        - brute-force solution for finding the maximum score by splitting the binary string `s`
        into two non-empty parts. 
        - the score is defined as the number of '0's in the left part plus the number of '1's 
        in the right part. 
        - the method handles small edge cases first, such as when the string has length 2 or 
        consists entirely of one character ('0' or '1'), where the maximum score is always `n-1`. 
        - for the general case, it iteratively considers every valid split position, explicitly
        counting '0's on the left and '1's on the right at each index, and 
        - tracks the maximum score found. This results in O(nÂ²) time due to repeated substring scans 
        and character counting.
